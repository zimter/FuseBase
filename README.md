2. Clone/Download the repo to your PC
3. Run `npm install` in the root

## Step 2: Run and JS inclusion
1. Run `npm start` in the root dir
2. Edit `src/client/client.js` with any text editor and change the `nodeJsIp` const to `http://yourip:3000` (you might wanna get a DDNS)
3. (Here is where the hosting part comes in) grab a link to `src/client/client.js` and include it wherever u wanna spread ur evilness (or goodness depending on what ur doing) AKA normal `<script src="link"></script>` anywhere in the html.
4. Get into the W.I.P Control Panel `yourip:3000`

## Step 3: Use existing modules or write your own:
